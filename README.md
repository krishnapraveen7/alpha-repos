# Repos that are starred
A basic repo that contains the starred repos of users and their README.md files.

# What is this for?
- I wanted to be able to easily access the README.md files for the repos that I have starred on GitHub.
- I also wanted to search and rag through online platforms where i can give git repo as a link

# What does it contain?
- It contains my starred repos and starred repos of other users like karpathy, chiphuyen, etc. (I will keep on adding more)

# What should i do with this?
- You index this in cursor and then use this for searching and ragging.
- You can use this to ask questions about what repo i can use say for inference etc.
- Create a huggingface assitant and give this repo as url and then keep asking questions

# Plan:
- Make a graph db that is connecting repos to users 
- Map repos to categories and subcategories
- Make it easier for users to find repos based on categories and subcategories
- Autolabelling of categories and subcategories for new repos
- Watching for new starred repos for all the users and then indexing them

Yes I am a repo hoarder.
