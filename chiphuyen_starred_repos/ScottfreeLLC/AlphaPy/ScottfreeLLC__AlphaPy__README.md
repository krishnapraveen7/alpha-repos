**AlphaPy** is a machine learning framework for both speculators and
data scientists. It is written in Python mainly with the ``scikit-learn``
and ``pandas`` libraries, as well as many other helpful
packages for feature engineering and visualization. Here are just
some of the things you can do with AlphaPy:

* Run machine learning models using ``scikit-learn``, ``Keras``, ``xgboost``, ``LightGBM``, and ``CatBoost``.
* Generate blended or stacked ensembles.
* Create models for analyzing the markets with *MarketFlow*.
* Predict sporting events with *SportFlow*.
* Develop trading systems and analyze portfolios using *MarketFlow*
  and Quantopian's ``pyfolio``.
