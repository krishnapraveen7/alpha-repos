# TokenMonster

**UPDATE:** [Benchmark results from pretraining 16 language models on different tokenizers.](./benchmark/pretrain.md)

TokenMonster is an ungreedy subword tokenizer and vocabulary generator, enabling language models to run faster, cheaper, smarter and generate longer streams of text.

<img width="661" alt="tokenmonster" src="https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster/assets/77910352/1136330a-bf25-4a17-8edb-06b90fffb236">

Large and sub-optimal vocabularies lead to the waste of computational and memory resources in language models. By switching to TokenMonster, you can potentially achieve the same or better performance with a vocabulary that is [less than a quarter of the size](https://alasdair.com/tokenmonster/benchmark.html?a=tiktoken%20cl100k_base&b=englishcode-24000-clean-v1&c=englishcode-16000-unfiltered-v1).

TokenMonster can train and generate an optimal vocabulary on a 1 GB dataset within 24 hours on a typical desktop. 442 [pretrained vocabularies](#pretrained-vocabularies) are provided, as well as tools to train your own vocabularies & implementations in Go, Python & Javascript for tokenization and detokenization using the pretrained or your own vocabularies.

You can [test TokenMonster in your browser here](https://alasdair.com/tokenmonster/), tokenizing live in native Javascript.

TokenMonster is a novel approach to tokenization with broad-ranging use potential, but its primary motivation is to improve the training, inference and context-length of large language models. By using a more optimal vocabulary and ungreedy tokenization algorithm, text can be represented with [37.5% fewer tokens at the same vocabulary size](https://alasdair.com/tokenmonster/benchmark.html?a=gpt2%20tokenmonster&b=tiktoken%20p50k_base&c=englishcode-50256-clean-v1) compared to other modern tokenizing methods, increasing the speed of inference, training and the length of text. And/or the vocabulary size can be [reduced by 75% or more](https://alasdair.com/tokenmonster/benchmark.html?a=tiktoken%20cl100k_base&b=tiktoken%20p50k_base&c=englishcode-24000-clean-v1), freeing resources that can be used to make the model smarter and faster.

You can also import existing vocabularies from other tokenizers, allowing you to take advantage of TokenMonster's fast, ungreedy tokenization whilst still using the existing vocabulary your model was trained for. TokenMonster vocabularies for GPT2 Tokenizer and LLaMa Tokenizer are included.

## Pretrained Vocabularies

442 vocabularies are planned or have already been built. Download them from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster), or in the Python library you can simply specify them by name and they'll be downloaded automatically. (Note: the pretrained vocabularies are still being trained, check [here](https://huggingface.co/alasdairforsythe/tokenmonster/tree/main/vocabs) to see which are currently available.)

- Choose a dataset from: `code` `english` `englishcode` `fiction`
- Choose a vocab size from: `1024` `2048` `4096` `8000` `16000` `24000` `32000` `40000` `50256` `65536` `100256`
- Choose an [optimization mode](#optimization-modes) from: `unfiltered` `clean` `balanced` `consistent` `strict`
- For a [capcode](#capcode) disabled vocabulary add: `nocapcode`
- Finally add the version number: `v1`

Examples: `fiction-24000-strict-v1` `code-4096-clean-nocapcode-v1`

Usage:
```python
import tokenmonster
vocab = tokenmonster.load("englishcode-32000-consistent-v1")
tokens = vocab.tokenize("This is a test.")
```
There are 2 additional pre-built vocabularies: `gpt2` and `llama`. These are imports of GPT2 Tokenizer and LLaMa Tokenizer from Hugging Face Transformers into TokenMonster. The tokens and IDs are identical, however they do not always tokenize the text in exactly the same way. For example, LLaMa Tokenizer on Hugging Face tokenizes " decoded" as ` dec` `oded`, whilst TokenMonster tokenizes [correctly] to ` decode` `d`. TokenMonster trained vocabularies are massively more efficient, so only use `gpt2` and `llama` if you have to. The scripts used to import them into TokenMonster are [here](./yaml_guide).
```python
vocab = tokenmonster.load("gpt2")
```

## Optimization Modes

All the optimization modes are lossless. The stricter the optimization mode (higher number), the more tokens will be used to tokenize the same text, but it'll be much easier for the language model to learn because the grammar is simpler. Less strict (lower number), more text can be represented with fewer tokens, but the language model will have to learn a more complicated grammar.

`0 unfiltered` allows the training process to freely determine the tokens. `clean` is preferred in almost every case, because `unfiltered` tends to result in overfitting, especially for code as it results in tokens for things like `\n\t\t\t\tif (`. Use `unfiltered` for tokenizing language or data that does not use spaces as word boundaries.

`1 clean` introduces filters to avoid overfitting. It forces the vocabulary to begin words with a space, and limits the way in which whitespace can be combined with other characters.

`2 balanced` prioritizes whole words and attempts to dissuade the vocabulary from doing things that are difficult to learn.

`3 consistent` is a looser version of `strict`. It aims to limit the number of different tokens that can represent the same word or phrase, and doesn't allow for open-close delimeters to be combined with words or each other. Numbers also become limited to fewer variants.

`4 strict` aims to have only 1 token per word, no matter how it is encoded. For example `However`, ` however,` and `HOWEVER!` will all use the same ` however` token, in combination with other tokens that indicate it's spacing and capitalization.

## Vocabulary Selection Guidance

View [TokenMonster Vocabulary Comparison](https://alasdair.com/tokenmonster/line.html), to see a line chart of the relationship between vocab size, optimization mode and characters/token. From this chart I can stipulate the rule of thumb that **every doubling of vocabulary size inscreases the characters/token by 0.5**. This pattern starts from vocab size 4096 and consistent up to 100256.

It's tempting to use large vocabularies, which has been norm, but you can see on the [TokenMonster Tester](https://alasdair.com/tokenmonster/) and [Interactive Benchmark](https://alasdair.com/tokenmonster/benchmark.html) that reducing the vocabulary by 50 - 75% can often result in only a relatively minor increase to the number of tokens required to tokenize it. Even the very general `englishcode` vocabularies, which are for all intents and purposes multi-lingual, do very well at vocab size `24000`. Story or article writing models can go as low as `4096` vocabulary size [and still tokenize at 4 characters per token](https://alasdair.com/tokenmonster/benchmark.html?a=fiction-8000-balanced-v1&b=fiction-4096-balanced-v1&c=fiction-2048-balanced-v1).

TokenMonster works well with small vocabularies because it's using an optimal selection process. In most cases it's simply not necessary to use vocabulary sizes greater than `32000`, unless it's a multi-lingual vocabulary. More is not better. Using a vocabulary that is excessively large can lead to inefficient usage of embeddings, not to mention an over-complicated grammar. The embeddings for all those unneeded tokens occupy memory and computational resources that could be used more efficiently.

In my opinion, the 100K vocabulary size is excessive and wasteful, unless your aim is to support at least three languages in the same vocabulary. With a 100K size, you have "spare" tokens. By "spare", I mean that the vocabulary starts assigning tokens to lengthy, specific sequences like "limitations under the License" and "#### According to", suggesting that the vocabulary has reached its optimal size and is now just compressing frequently occurring strings.

My advice is to find the smallest vocabulary size that meets your requirements. With this, you can either be content with a smaller, faster model, or opt to augment the size of the embeddings accordingly, or find a balance between the two.

In regards to optimization modes, `strict` is the one to go for if your model is limited by its size or largely undertrained. If it's a small model that isn't particularly smart, and you want to get the most out of it, choose `strict` because it'll probably result in a smarter model given that the simpler grammar is quicker to learn (words, punctuation and modifiers are all separate tokens.) On the other hand, if you're training something serious with enough training data so that each token is exposed to a variety of contexts in order to learn it's more complex grammar, you probably want to go for `clean` or `balanced`.

`strict` performs very well with longform natural text, such as novels and articles, but it's too strict for code. `consistent` will give the best balance of consistency for tokenizing code whilst keeping the grammar simple. `balanced` and `clean` are excellent at compressing code into fewer tokens, but this comes with the trade-off of more complex grammar. That said, a smaller vocabulary implies a simpler grammar (less possible combinations), so it may be in your interest to aim for `balanced` with a fairly small vocabulary size, such as `16000`. All of this you can determine by playing around with [TokenMonster Tester](https://alasdair.com/tokenmonster/).

## Capcode

[Capcode](https://github.com/alasdairforsythe/capcode) is an alternative encoding for uppercase in UTF-8 text, supporting all UTF-8 characters. It's completely lossless, changing the way in which capital letters are encoded so they can share tokens with lowercase letters but without losing any information. In theory, capcode makes it easier for a model to learn the meaning of words. Additionally, capcode makes for more efficient tokenization because it frees up so many tokens that would otherwise be used for uppercase variants of already existing lowercase tokens.

## Normalization

TokenMonster is designed to be plug-and-play, taking care of normalization concerns for you. UTF-8 and UTF-16 vocabularies are automatically NFD normalized and encoded Little Endian regardless of architecture. When tokenizing, the exact same transformations are applied transparently, so you can pass a string to either UTF-8 or UTF-16 vocabularies, with or without capcode, and on either Little or Big Endian architecture, and it will be processed correctly.

No normalizations are applied to charset "None" vocabularies. If you're not sure which to choose, UTF-8 is preferred.

## How does it work and how is it different from BPE?

Byte-Pair-Encoding starts with single byte tokens and merges frequently occuring tokens together iteratively, growing the vocabulary out of single characters. TokenMonster takes an entirely different approach, beginning with all possible tokens, and distilling the vocabulary down to the vocab size using a method inspired by chemical distillation. TokenMonster thereby does not run into the issue BPE has, that once a branch is chosen, it's assumed to be beneficial, and although it can later be pruned, the alternative branch that might have performed better has already been lost.

The secret sauce that enables TokenMonster to outperform other algorithms is made from:
1. The distillation method is an effective means of separating that which is wanted from that which is not, without losing any of the cream.
2. The training process targets the tokenization method being used. The vocabulary is generated to be optimal for the specific tokenization algorithm and dataset, which is a necessary step for optimal tokenization.

In simplified terms it does the following:
- Generates all possible tokens in the dataset (40 billion in 1 GB of text)
- Deletes all tokens that have no more than 100 occurrences (4 million)
- Generates random vocabularies of vocab_size
- Tokenizes the dataset using the target tokenization algorithm with the random vocabulary
- Deletes the 1% "worst" scoring tokens
- Repeat hundreds of thousands of times
- When vocab_size is reached, resurrect potential tokens
- Keep doing this until a more optimal vocabulary cannot be found 1000 times in a row

TokenMonster does not need any information about the language or structure, and results in a neat list of words, subwords and common phrases. Sample:
```
a number of 
a series of 
a wonderful 
ability and 
able to get 
about being 
about their 
account for 
acknowledge 
acquisition 
addition to 
address the 
advertising 
affected by 
after being 
against the 
```

## The Ungreedy Tokenization Algorithm

TokenMonster uses an ungreedy tokenization method in which each token has up to 2 alternatives selected during training, which are subwords of itself. First the longest token that matches the next segment of text is selected in a greedy fashion. The alternative tokens are looked up on an index that is included in the vocabulary file. The longest token matching the following text segment is found for the original and its alternatives, giving 3 possible branches. If any of those do not end on a word boundary, a further branch is followed utilizing a forward delete token, which allows for words beginning with a space to be used as parts of other words. The 6 total branches are scored based on various rules, the optimal branch is chosen and the tokenization continues along that branch.

Because the training process targets the tokenization algorithm, the training is not only selecting for tokens but selecting for the relationship between tokens in the vocabulary.

## Datasets

The datasets used for generating the pretrained vocabularies are all available on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/alasdairforsythe/text-english-code-fiction-nonfiction). The sources and scripts used to generate these datasets are included in the training directory.

The training data mostly came from Red Pajamas [1B Token Sample](https://huggingface.co/datasets/togethercomputer/RedPajama-Data-1T-Sample). However, to reduce formal English and emphasize other languages, informal writing and code, c4_sample & cc_sample were cropped to 100MB, and [Reddit conversations](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SophieTr/reddit_clean) data were added (also cropped to 100MB.)

Additionally, equally weighted code samples of 2MB per language (code_2mb) and 10MB per language (code_10mb) were added for 30 different programming languages to ensure all programming languages have representation. The source of this is [codeparrot/github-code](https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeparrot/github-code). To ensure a range of coding styles, I allowed only 1 file per GitHub repository, and per file a maximum of 200 lines selected from the middle of the file.

Given the evolving nature of writing styles, I felt that book_sample.txt, which consists of out-of-copyright books, was not a good representation of contemporary fiction. To better represent a more modern style, I curated fiction.txt and fiction_100mb.txt by throwing together a few other datasets and cleaning it up.

Note: fiction_100mb.txt is a subset of fiction.txt, and code_2mb.txt is a subset of code_10mb.txt.
