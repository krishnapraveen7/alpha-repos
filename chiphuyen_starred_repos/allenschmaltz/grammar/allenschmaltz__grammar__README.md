Under development.

A trained model (trained on the NUCLE + Lang-8 data) is available here (in the folder w_n_w_l8_pyrep_s79_t100_rnn750_la2_v50000_brnn_opennmt_b48):

This is for use with the code in https://github.com/allenschmaltz/grammar/tree/master/code/_dev/constrained, which implements constrained decoding (i.e., changes not conforming to the diff tag semantics are not allowed during beam search). An example of decoding the CoNLL dev set appears in [example_run.sh](code/notes/example_run.sh).

For reference, the effectiveness on the CoNLL dev/test data is slightly higher than that of the original model used in the EMNLP paper. (This is due to the model and not due to changes in decoding.) Results for unconstrained and constrained decoding are included below (and are not significantly different):

Unconstrained decoding followed by a post-hoc fix of the tags:

Dev:

Precision: 0.49; Recall: 0.15; F_0.5: 0.34

Test:

Precision: 0.54; Recall: 0.24; F_0.5: 0.43

Constrained decoding:

Dev:

Precision: 0.49; Recall: 0.15; F_0.5: 0.34

Test:

Precision: 0.53; Recall: 0.24; F_0.5: 0.43

For historical purposes, the model used in the original paper (for use with the [original code](code/replication_fork)) is available at the above link in the folder legacy/word_nucle_w_lang8_v1_srclen79_trglen100_rnn750_la2_v50000_brnn_opennmt_batchsize48.
