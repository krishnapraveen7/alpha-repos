# QuMat

QuMat is a POC of a high level Python library for intefacing with multiple quantum computing backends. It is designed to be easy to use and to abstract the particularities of each backend, so that you may 'write once, run anywhere.' Like the Java of quantum computing, but Java is the new COBOL so we're trying to distance ourselves from that comparison :P

Check out [basic gates](docs/basic_gates.md) for a quick introduction to the basic gates which are basically all that exist right now (and even those only exist for `qiskit`).

## Getting started

To install dependencies, run the following:
```
pip install -U poetry
poetry install
```
