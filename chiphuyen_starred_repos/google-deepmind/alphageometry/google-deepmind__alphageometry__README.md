# Solving Olympiad Geometry without Human Demonstrations


This repository contains the code necessary to
reproduce DDAR and AlphaGeometry,
the two geometry theorem provers
introduced in the [Nature 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06747-5) paper:

## Dependencies

For the instructions presented below,
we use Python 3.10.9, and dependencies with their exact
version numbers listed in `requirements.txt`.

Our code depends on `meliad`, which is
not a registered package with `pip`. See instructions below
for how to manually install `meliad`.

Note that one can still run the DDAR solver
without the `meliad` and `sentencepiece` dependencies.

## Run the instructions

All instructions in this `README.md` can be run in one go by:

```
bash run.sh
```

Below, we explain these instructions step-by-step.

## Install dependencies, download weights and vocabulary.

Installation is done in a virtual environment:

```
virtualenv -p python3 .
source ./bin/activate
pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.txt
```

Download weights and vocabulary:

```
bash download.sh
DATA=ag_ckpt_vocab
```

Finally, install `meliad` separately as it is not
registered with `pip`:

```
MELIAD_PATH=meliad_lib/meliad
mkdir -p $MELIAD_PATH
git clone https://github.com/google-research/meliad $MELIAD_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$MELIAD_PATH
```

## Set up common flags

Before running the python scripts,
let us first prepare some commonly used flags.
The symbolic engine needs definitions and deduction rules to operate.
These definitions and rules are provided in two text files
`defs.txt` and `rules.txt`.

```shell
DDAR_ARGS=(
  --defs_file=$(pwd)/defs.txt \
  --rules_file=$(pwd)/rules.txt \
);
```

Next, we define the flags relevant to the proof search.
To reproduce the simple examples below,
we use lightweight values for the proof search parameters:

```shell
BATCH_SIZE=2
BEAM_SIZE=2
DEPTH=2

SEARCH_ARGS=(
  --beam_size=$BEAM_SIZE
  --search_depth=$DEPTH
)
```

NOTE: The results in our paper can be obtained by setting
`BATCH_SIZE=32`, `BEAM_SIZE=512`, `DEPTH=16`
as described in section Methods.
To stay under IMO time limits, 4 V100-GPUs and 250 CPU workers
are needed as shown in Extended Data - Figure 1.
Note that we also strip away other memory/speed optimizations
due to internal dependencies and to promote code clarity.

Assume the downloaded checkpoint and vocabulary is placed in `DATA`,
and the installed `meliad` source code is at `MELIAD_PATH`.
We make use of the `gin` library to manage model configurations,
following `meliad` conventions. We now define the flags relevant to the
language model:

```shell
LM_ARGS=(
  --ckpt_path=$DATA \
  --vocab_path=$DATA/geometry.757.model
  --gin_search_paths=$MELIAD_PATH/transformer/configs,$(pwd) \
  --gin_file=base_htrans.gin \
  --gin_file=size/medium_150M.gin \
  --gin_file=options/positions_t5.gin \
  --gin_file=options/lr_cosine_decay.gin \
  --gin_file=options/seq_1024_nocache.gin \
  --gin_file=geometry_150M_generate.gin \
  --gin_param=DecoderOnlyLanguageModelGenerate.output_token_losses=True \
  --gin_param=TransformerTaskConfig.batch_size=$BATCH_SIZE \
  --gin_param=TransformerTaskConfig.sequence_length=128 \
  --gin_param=Trainer.restore_state_variables=False
);
```

TIP: Note that you can still run the DDAR solver
without defining `SEARCH_ARGS` and `LM_ARGS`.
In such case, simply disable the import of the `lm_inference` module
inside `alphageometry.py`.

## Run DDAR

The script loads a problem by reading a list of problems
from a text file and solves the specific problem in the list according
to its name. We pass these two pieces of information through the flags
`--problems_file` and `--problem_name`.
We use `--mode=ddar` to indicate that we want to use the DDAR solver.

Below we showed this solver solving IMO 2000 P1:

```shell
python -m alphageometry \
--alsologtostderr \
--problems_file=$(pwd)/imo_ag_30.txt \
--problem_name=translated_imo_2000_p1 \
--mode=ddar \
"${DDAR_ARGS[@]}"
```

Expect the following output

```shell
graph.py:468] translated_imo_2000_p1
graph.py:469] a b = segment a b; g1 = on_tline g1 a a b; g2 = on_tline g2 b b a; m = on_circle m g1 a, on_circle m g2 b; n = on_circle n g1 a, on_circle n g2 b; c = on_pline c m a b, on_circle c g1 a; d = on_pline d m a b, on_circle d g2 b; e = on_line e a c, on_line e b d; p = on_line p a n, on_line p c d; q = on_line q b n, on_line q c d ? cong e p e q

==========================
```

The output first includes a list of relevant premises that it uses,
and then proof steps that gradually build up the proof.
All predicates are numbered to track how they are derived
from the premises, and to show that the proof is fully justified.

TIP: Additionally passing the flag `--out_file=path/to/output/text/file.txt`
will write the proof to a text file.

Running on all problems in `imo_ag_30.txt` will yield solutions to
14 of them, as reported in Table 1 in our paper.

## Run AlphaGeometry:

As a simple example, we load `--problem_name=orthocenter`
from `--problem_file=examples.txt`.
This time, we pass `--mode=alphageometry` to use the AlphaGeometry solver
and pass the `SEARCH_ARGS` and `LM_ARGS` flags.

```shell
python -m alphageometry \
--alsologtostderr \
--problems_file=$(pwd)/examples.txt \
--problem_name=orthocenter \
--mode=alphageometry \

```

alphageometry.py:505] Solved.
```

NOTE: Point `H` is automatically renamed to `D`,
as the LM is trained on synthetic problems
where the points are named alphabetically, and so it expects
the same during test time.

NOTE: In this implementation of AlphaGeometry,
we removed all optimizations that are dependent on
internal infrastructure, e.g.,
parallelized model inference on multi GPUs,
parallelized DDAR on multiple CPUs,
parallel execution of LM and DDAR,
shared pool of CPU workers across different problems, etc.
We also removed some memory/speed optimizations and code
abstractions in favor of code clarity.

As can be seen in the output, initially DDAR failed to solve the problem.
The LM proposes two auxiliary constructions (because `BATCH_SIZE=2`):

* `e = eqdistance e c a b, eqdistance e b a c`, i.e.,
construct `E` as the intersection of circle (center=C, radius=AB) and
circle (center=B, radius=AC). This construction has a score of `-1.186`.
* `e = on_line e a c, on_line e b d`, i.e.,
`E` is the intersection of `AC` and `BD`.
This construction has a higher score (`-1.102287`) than the previous.

Since the second construction has a higher score, DDAR attempted the second
construction first and found the solution right away.
The proof search therefore terminates and there is no second iteration.

## Results

Before attempting to reproduce the AlphaGeometry numbers in our paper,
please make sure to pass all tests in the prepared test suite:

```
bash run_tests.sh
```

NOTE: [Issues#14](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphageometry/issues/14) reports that although the top beam decodes are still the same, the LM is not giving the same score for different users.

Then, pass the corresponding values for `--problem_file` (column)
and `--mode` (row), and
iterate on all problems to obtain the following results:
