> Fawzi, A. et al. [Discovering faster matrix multiplication algorithms with
reinforcement learning](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05172-4).
*Nature* **610** (2022)

There are 4 independent directories:

- `algorithms` contains algorithms discovered by AlphaTensor, represented as
factorizations of matrix multiplication tensors, and a Colab showing how to load
these.

- `benchmarking` contains a script that can be used to measure the actual speed
of matrix multiplication algorithms on an NVIDIA V100 GPU.

- `nonequivalence` contains 14,236 nonequivalent algorithms discovered by
AlphaTensor for the same matrix multiplication problem (multiplying 4x4
matrices), and a Colab that verifies their nonequivalence.

- `recombination` contains the code we used to decompose larger matrix
multiplication tensors by recombining factorizations of smaller ones.


## Installation

- `algorithms`: No installation required.

- `benchmarking`: See `README` in the subdirectory.

- `nonequivalence`: No installation required.

- `recombination`: A machine with Python 3 installed is required. The required
dependencies (`numpy` and `absl-py`) can be installed by executing
`pip3 install -r alphatensor/recombination/requirements.txt`.

## Usage

- `algorithms`: The notebook `explore_factorizations.ipynb` can be opened via
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/alphatensor/blob/master/algorithms/explore_factorizations.ipynb).
When running the code, you will be asked to upload a file containing the
factorizations. Please select either of the compressed NumPy files
`factorizations_r.npz` (containing algoritms in standard arithmetic) or
`factorizations_f2.npz` (algorithms in arithmetic modulo 2).

- `benchmarking`: See `README` in the subdirectory, and Supplement D of the
paper.

- `nonequivalence`: The notebook `inspect_factorizations_notebook.ipynb` can be
opened via
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/alphatensor/blob/master/nonequivalence/inspect_factorizations_notebook.ipynb).
When running the code, you will be asked to upload a file. Please select the
compressed NumPy file `alphatensor_14236_factorizations.npz`. This will upload
the factorizations found by AlphaTensor, and then compute invariants certifying
that they are all nonequivalent. For more details, see Supplement B of the
paper.

- `recombination`: Execute `python3 -m alphatensor.recombination.example` on the
command line, **from the parent directory that contains the `alphatensor`
repository as a subdirectory**. For more details, see Supplement H of the paper.
