The Google AI Swift SDK is the easiest way for Swift developers to build with
the Gemini API. The Gemini API gives you access to Gemini
[models](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini) created by
[Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction).
Gemini models are built from the ground up to be multimodal, so you can reason
seamlessly across text, images, and code.

> [!CAUTION] **The Google AI SDK for Swift is recommended for prototyping
> only.** If you plan to enable billing, we strongly recommend that you use a
> backend SDK to access the Google AI Gemini API. You risk potentially exposing
> your API key to malicious actors if you embed your API key directly in your
> Swift app or fetch it remotely at runtime.

## Get started with the Gemini API

1.  Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
2.  Login with your Google account.
3.  [Create an API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). Note that in
    Europe the free tier is not available.
4.  Check out this repository. \
    `git clone https://github.com/google/generative-ai-swift`
5.  Open and build the sample app in the `Examples` folder of this repo.
6.  Run the app once to ensure the build script generates an empty
    `GenerativeAI-Info.plist` file
7.  Paste your API key into the `API_KEY` property in the
    `GenerativeAI-Info.plist` file.
8.  Run the app
9.  For detailed instructions, try the
    [Swift SDK tutorial](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/swift_quickstart) on
    [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev).

## Usage example

1.  Add [`generative-ai-swift`](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-swift)
    to your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager.

2.  Import the `GoogleGenerativeAI` module

```swift
import GoogleGenerativeAI
```

1.  Initialize the model

```swift
let model = GenerativeModel(name: "gemini-1.5-flash-latest", apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

1.  Run a prompt

```swift
let cookieImage = UIImage(...)
let prompt = "Do these look store-bought or homemade?"

let response = try await model.generateContent(prompt, cookieImage)
```

For detailed instructions, you can find a
[quickstart](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/swift_quickstart) for the Google AI
SDK for Swift in the Google documentation.

This quickstart describes how to add your API key and the Swift package to your
app, initialize the model, and then call the API to access the model. It also
describes some additional use cases and features, like streaming, counting
tokens, and controlling responses.

## Logging

To enable additional logging in the Xcode console, including a cURL command and
raw stream response for each model request, add
`-GoogleGenerativeAIDebugLogEnabled` as `Arguments Passed On Launch` in the
Xcode scheme.

## Command Line Tool

A command line tool is available to experiment with Gemini model requests via
Xcode or the command line:

1.  `open Examples/GenerativeAICLI/Package.swift`
1.  Run in Xcode and examine the console to see the options.
1.  Edit the scheme's `Arguments Passed On Launch` with the desired options.

## Developers who use the PaLM SDK for Swift (Deprecated)

> [!IMPORTANT] The PaLM API is deprecated for use with Google AI services and
> tools (but *not* for Vertex AI). Learn more about this deprecation, its
> timeline, and how to migrate to use Gemini in the
> [PaLM API deprecation guide](http://ai.google.dev/palm_docs/deprecation).

​​If you're using the PaLM SDK for Swift, review the information below to
continue using the **deprecated** PaLM SDK until you've migrated to the new
version that allows you to use Gemini.

-   To continue using PaLM models, make sure your app depends on version
    [`0.3.0`](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-swift/releases/tag/0.3.0)
    *up to* the next minor version
    ([`0.4.0`](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-swift/releases/tag/0.4.0))
    of `generative-ai-swift`.

-   When you're ready to use Gemini models, migrate your code to the Gemini API
    and update your app's `generative-ai-swift` dependency to version `0.4.0` or
    higher.

To see the PaLM documentation and code, go to the
[`palm` branch](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-swift/tree/palm).
