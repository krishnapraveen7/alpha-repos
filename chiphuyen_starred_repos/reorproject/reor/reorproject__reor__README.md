## About
**Reor** is an AI-powered desktop note-taking app: it automatically links related notes, answers questions on your notes, provides semantic search and can generate AI flashcards. Everything is stored locally and you can edit your notes with an Obsidian-like markdown editor. 

The hypothesis of the project is that AI tools for thought should run models locally *by default*. Reor stands on the shoulders of the giants [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), [Transformers.js](https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js) & [LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb) to enable both LLMs and embedding models to run locally:

1.  Every note you write is chunked and embedded into an internal vector database.
2.  Related notes are connected automatically via vector similarity.
3.  LLM-powered Q&A does RAG on your corpus of notes.
4.  Everything can be searched semantically.

One way to think about Reor is as a RAG app with two generators: the LLM and the human. In Q&A mode, the LLM is fed retrieved context from the corpus to help answer a query. Similarly, in editor mode, the human can toggle the sidebar to reveal related notes "retrieved" from the corpus. This is quite a powerful way of "augmenting" your thoughts by cross-referencing ideas in a current note against related ideas from your corpus.

  
### Getting Started
1. Download from [reorproject.org](https://reorproject.org) or [releases](https://github.com/reorproject/reor/releases). Mac, Linux & Windows are all supported.
2. Install like a normal App.


### Running local models
Reor interacts directly with Ollama which means you can download and run models locally right from inside Reor. Head to Settings->Add New Local LLM then enter the name of the model you want Reor to download. You can find available models [here](https://ollama.com/library).

You can also [connect to an OpenAI-compatible API](https://www.reorproject.org/docs/documentation/openai-like-api) like Oobabooga, Ollama or OpenAI itself!

### Importing notes from other apps
Reor works within a single directory in the filesystem. You choose the directory on first boot.
To import notes/files from another app, you'll need to populate that directory manually with markdown files. Note that if you have frontmatter in your markdown files it may not parse correctly. Integrations with other apps are hopefully coming soon!
