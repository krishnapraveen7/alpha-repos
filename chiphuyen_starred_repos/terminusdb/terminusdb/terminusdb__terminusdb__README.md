## TerminusDB is a distributed database with a collaboration model.

It is designed to be like git, but for data. If you are reading this, **give this repo a star**.

The building blocks of the model are -

  - Revision Control: commits for every update
  - Diff: differences between commits can be interpreted as patches between states
  - Push/Pull/Clone: communicate diffs between nodes using push / pull / clone
  - Query: You can query any state of the database at any commit.

TerminusDB allows you to link JSON documents in a knowledge graph through a [document API](https://terminusdb.com/docs/document-insertion). TerminusDB is available as a standalone server, or you can use our headless content and knowledge management system [TerminusCMS](https://dashboard.terminusdb.com/).

### TerminusDB Version 11

[TerminusDB 11](https://github.com/terminusdb/terminusdb/releases/tag/v11.0.0) features a new Rustified storage backend that reduces storage overhead and latency, improves search performance, and simplifies interchange. TerminusDB 11 also comes with some exciting features to make building easier and faster -

- [GraphQL](https://terminusdb.com/docs/graphql-basics) - Use GraphQL as a proper graph query language with deep link discover and path queries
- Added `@unfoldable` document flag to frames - Making data curation easier by unfolding subdocuments within a frame to add all relevant data in one place
- Add `@metadata` to frames - Include additional metadata to document frames including data formatted as Markdown.


## Installation Guide

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/terminusdb)

The easiest way to install TerminusDB as a developer is by using the [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/terminusdb). It does not provide a daemon and is mainly intended for developers that want to try TerminusDB.

For deployments, or if you want to use the local dashboard:

1. Add the following to a .env file in the source directory:

```shell
OPENAI_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_KEY_HERE
# And optionally specify number of pages for the vector database
# for instance
BUFFER_AMOUNT=120000
```

2. `docker compose up`

You should be able to view TerminusDB running by default at `localhost:6363`

> If you're installing TerminusDB on Windows with Docker, our friends at DFRNT wrote this [comprehensive guide](https://dfrnt.com/blog/2023-02-25-run-terminusdb-on-windows-with-docker/).

You can also install TerminusDB from the [Source Code](https://terminusdb.com/docs/install-terminusdb-from-source-code).


## TerminusDB CLI

A simple example creating a person with friends can be created as follows:

```shell
terminusdb db create admin/example1
terminusdb doc insert --graph_type=schema admin/example1 <<EOF
{ "@id" : "Person",
  "@type" : "Class",
  "name" : "xsd:string",
  "occupation" : "xsd:string",
  "friends" : { "@type" : "Set",
                "@class" : "Person" }}
EOF
terminusdb doc insert admin/example1 --message='adding Gavin' <<EOF
{ "@type" : "Person","name" : "Gavin", "occupation" : "Coder"}
EOF
```

You can attach this to a database on TerminusCMS in order to distribute it by setting your remote. First you will need to create
a resource from [TerminusCMS](https://dashboard.terminusdb.com/). This is analogous to creating a repository on GitHub.

Log into TerminusCMS, create a new data product, and make sure
you have an access token to the team in which we created that data
product. Then copy the URL to clone from the data product info page.

If you make a data product called `example` in the team
`Terminators`. We could then issue the following command using the
TerminusDB CLI. You should get an API token from your profile page and replace `'XYZ'` with this token.

```shell
terminusdb remote add admin/example1 origin 'https://cloud-dev.terminusdb.com/Terminators/example' --token='XYZ'
terminusdb fetch admin/example1 --token='XYZ'
terminusdb push admin/example1 --token='XYZ'
```

Once completed, you'll have a remote copy of this database.
