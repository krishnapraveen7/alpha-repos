## ✨ Features

- **Generative AI Native**: Supports multiple LLMs like ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini Pro, Dify, and others, with function calling (ChatGPT/Gemini) and multimodal capabilities.

- **Dialog control**: Integrates Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech (OpenAI, Azure, Google, Watson, VOICEVOX, VOICEROID, etc.), manages dialog state (context or memory), extracts intents and routes topics, supports wakeword detection.
- **Multi platforms**: Compatible with Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, and other Unity-supported platforms, including VR, AR, and WebGL.

... and more! See [ChatdollKit Documentation](Documents/manual.md) to learn details.


## 🚀 Quick start

You can learn how to setup ChatdollKit by watching this video that runs the demo scene(including chat with ChatGPT): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRtm18QSJtc

### 📦 Import packages

Download the latest version of [ChatdollKit.unitypackage](https://github.com/uezo/ChatdollKit/releases) and import it into your Unity project after import dependencies;

- `Burst` from Unity Package Manager (Window > Package Manager)
- [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask)(Tested on Ver.2.5.4)
- [uLipSync](https://github.com/hecomi/uLipSync)(Tested on v3.1.0)
- For VRM model: [UniVRM](https://github.com/vrm-c/UniVRM/releases/tag/v0.89.0)(v0.89.0) and [VRM Extension](https://github.com/uezo/ChatdollKit/releases)
- JSON.NET: If your project doesn't have JSON.NET, add it from Package Manager > [+] > Add package from git URL... > com.unity.nuget.newtonsoft-json
- [Azure Speech SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/azure/ai-services/speech-service/quickstarts/setup-platform?pivots=programming-language-csharp&tabs=macos%2Cubuntu%2Cdotnetcli%2Cunity%2Cjre%2Cmaven%2Cnodejs%2Cmac%2Cpypi#install-the-speech-sdk-for-unity): (Optional) Required for real-time speech recognition using a stream.

### 🐟 Resource preparation

Add 3D model to the scene and adjust as you like. Also install required resources for the 3D model like shaders etc.
In this README, I use Cygnet-chan that we can perchase at Booth. https://booth.pm/ja/items/1870320

And, import animation clips. In this README, I use [Anime Girls Idle Animations Free](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/animations/anime-girl-idle-animations-free-150406). I believe it is worth for you to purchase the pro edition👍


### 🎁 Put ChatdollKit prefab

Put `ChatdollKit/Prefabs/ChatdollKit` or `ChatdollKit/Prefabs/ChatdollKitVRM` to the scene. And, create EventSystem to use UI components.

### 🐈 ModelController

Select `Setup ModelController` in the context menu of ModelController. If *NOT* VRM, make sure that shapekey for blink to `Blink Blend Shape Name` is set after setup. If not correct or blank, set it manually.

<img src="Documents/Images/modelcontroller.png" width="640">


### 💃 Animator

Select `Setup Animator` in the context menu of ModelController and select the folder that contains animation clips or their parent folder. In this case put animation clips in `01_Idles` and `03_Others` onto `Base Layer` for override blending, `02_Layers` onto `Additive Layer` for additive blending.

<img src="Documents/Images/animator.gif" width="640">

Next, see the `Base Layer` of newly created AnimatorController in the folder you selected. Confirm the value for transition to the state you want to set it for idle animation.

<img src="Documents/Images/idleanimation01.png" width="640">

Lastly, set the value to `Idle Animation Value` on the inspector of ModelController.

<img src="Documents/Images/idleanimation02.png" width="640">


### 🦜 DialogController

On the inspector of `DialogController`, set `Wake Word` to start conversation (e.g. hello / こんにちは🇯🇵), `Cancel Word` to stop comversation (e.g. end / おしまい🇯🇵), `Prompt Voice` to require voice request from user (e.g. what's up? / どうしたの？🇯🇵).

<img src="Documents/Images/dialogcontroller.png" width="640">


### 🍣 ChatdollKit

Select the speech service (OpenAI/Azure/Google/Watson) you use and set API key and some properties like Region and BaseUrl on inspector of ChatdollKit.

<img src="Documents/Images/chatdollkit.png" width="640">


### 🍳 Skill

Attach the common components to use LLM:

- ChatdollKit/Scripts/LLM/LLMRouter
- ChatdollKit/Scripts/LLM/LLMContentSkill

Additionally, attach the specific LLM vendor component you want to use and set the API key:

- ChatdollKit/Scripts/LLM/ChatGPT/ChatGPTService
- ChatdollKit/Scripts/LLM/Claude/ClaudeService
- ChatdollKit/Scripts/LLM/Gemini/GeminiService


### 🤗 Face Expression (*NON* VRM only)

Select `Setup VRC FaceExpression Proxy` in the context menu of VRC FaceExpression Proxy. Neutral, Joy, Angry, Sorrow and Fun face expression with all zero value and Blink face with blend shape for blink = 100.0f are automatically created.

<img src="Documents/Images/faceexpression.png" width="640">

You can edit shape keys by editing Face Clip Configuration directly or by capturing on inspector of VRCFaceExpressionProxy.

<img src="Documents/Images/faceexpressionedit.png" width="640">


### 🥳 Run

Press Play button of Unity editor. You can see the model starts with idling animation and blinking.

- Say the word you set to `Wake Word` on inspector (e.g. hello / こんにちは🇯🇵)
- Your model will reply the word you set to `Prompt Voice` on inspector (e.g. what's up? / どうしたの？🇯🇵)
- Say something you want to echo like "Hello world!"
- Your model will reply "Hello world"

## 🌊 Use Azure OpenAI Service

To use Azure OpenAI Service set following info on inspector of ChatGPTService component:

1. Endpoint url with configurations to `Chat Completion Url`
```
format: https://{your-resource-name}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{deployment-id}/chat/completions?api-version={api-version}
```

2. API Key to `Api Key`

3. Set true to `Is Azure`

NOTE: `Model` on inspector is ignored. Engine in url is used.


## 👷‍♀️ Build your own app

See the `MultiSkills` example. That is more rich application including:

- Dialog Routing: `Router` is an example of how to decide the topic user want to talk
- Processing dialog: `TranslateDialog` is an example that shows how to process dialog

We are now preparing contents to create more rich virtual assistant using ChatdollKit.


## 🌐 Run on WebGL

Refer to the following tips for now. We are preparing demo for WebGL.

- It takes 5-10 minutes to build. (It depends on machine spec)
- Very hard to debug. Error message doesn't show the stacktrace: `To use dlopen, you need to use Emscripten’s linking support, see https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki/Linking` 
- Built-in Async/Await doesn't work (app stops at `await`) because JavaScript doesn't support threading. Use [UniTask](https://github.com/Cysharp/UniTask) instead.
- CORS required for HTTP requests.
- Microphone is not supported. Use `ChatdollMicrophone` that is compatible with WebGL.
- Compressed audio formats like MP3 are not supported. Use WAV in TTS Loaders.
- OVRLipSync is not supported. Use [uLipSync](https://github.com/hecomi/uLipSync) and [uLipSyncWebGL](https://github.com/uezo/uLipSyncWebGL) instead.
- If you want to show multibyte characters in message window put the font that includes multibyte characters to your project and set it to message windows.
