# datascience-fails
Collection of articles listing reasons why data science projects fail.

If you have an article that should be added, please suggest it with its link in the [Issues](https://github.com/xLaszlo/datascience-fails/issues).

I summarised my findings on my blog: [Data Science Risk Categorisation](https://laszlo.substack.com/p/data-science-risk-categorisation)

I added the post to my new company's ([hypergolic.co.uk](https://hypergolic.co.uk/)) blog as well at : [Data Science Risk Categorisation](https://hypergolic.co.uk/blog/data-science-risk/)

After looking through the 300+ failures listed below there is a notable absence of any concern about _domain_ experts and any collaboration with them apart from off-hand mentions regarding labelled data. The reader should take this into account when using the above categorisation. (Laszlo)

01. Vague success metrics of the ML model
02. Even if we had the perfect model — no clue of how it will be used within existing workflows
03. Building a 100% accurate model — no clarity on the acceptable trade-offs such as precision versus recall
04. Using a hammer to kill an ant — not checking the performance of simpler alternatives
05. Not all ML problems are worth solving — the impact may not be worth the effort
06. Drowning the business team in technical mumbo jumbo
07. I thought this dataset attribute means something else
08. 5 definitions of a business metric
09. Where is the dataset I need for my model?
10. The data warehouse is stale
11. Need to instrument app for more clickstream events — it will take months
12. Assuming all the datasets have the same quality
13. Customer changed preference to not use their data for ML. Why are those records still included
14. Uncoordinated schema changes at the data source
15. We have lots of data — don't forget data expires?
16. Systematic data issues making overall dataset bias
17. Unnoticed sudden distribution changes in the data
18. Using all the data for training — each model iteration can take days
19. We are using the best polyglot datastores — but how do I now write queries effectively across this data?
20. Training versus inference inconsistency
21. Model accuracy too good to be true — check for feature leakage
22. Limited Feature value coverage
23. Flaky pipeline for generating features that are time-dependent
24. Lack of balance between bias (underfitting) and variance (overfitting)
25. Compromising interpretability prematurely for performance
26. Always using deep learning instead of traditional feature engineering
27. Not applying hashing for sparse features
28. Not attempting to reduce the dimensionality of models
29. Ad-hoc tuning is faster compared to a scientific approach
30. Improper tracking of details related to model versions and experiments
31. Ignoring the specificity and sparsity trade-off
32. Prematurely jumping to online experimentation
33. Not measuring model’s sensitivity to recency
34. Not paying attention to infrastructure capacity
35. Evaluating models using different datasets
36. Reporting model accuracy for the overall data
37. Training results not reproducible
38. Long time before first online experiment
39. Model behaves differently in online experimentation compared to offline validation
40. Ignoring feedback loops
41. Making multiple changes within an experiment
42. Ad-hoc framework to analyze the results of the experiment
43. No backup plan if the test goes south

46. Metrics processing pipelines completed successfully but results are wrong?
47. Response time to generate an inference is too high
48. Data quality issues at source, or ingestion into the lake, or ETL processing
49. Cloud costs jumped up 3X this month

- Ensure you have a problem that both can and should be solved by AI.
- Include highly integrated subject matter experts, data scientists, and data architects in your software engineering teams.
- Take your data seriously to prevent it from consuming your project. 
- Choose algorithms based on what you need your model to do, not on their popularity. 
- Secure AI systems by applying highly integrated monitoring and mitigation strategies. 
- Define checkpoints to account for the potential needs of recovery, traceability, and decision justification.
- Incorporate user experience and interaction to constantly validate and evolve models and architecture. 
- Design for the interpretation of the inherent ambiguity in the output.
- Implement loosely coupled solutions that can be extended or replaced to adapt to ruthless and inevitable data and model changes and algorithm innovations. 
- Commit sufficient time and expertise for constant and enduring change over the life of the system.
- Treat ethics as both a software design consideration and a policy concern.

- From **AI’s biggest risk factor: Data gone wrong** [(link)](https://www.idginsiderpro.com/article/3254693/ais-biggest-risk-factor-data-gone-wrong.html)
    - Several recent research studies demonstrated that popular data sets used to train image recognition AI included gender biases.
    - You can't outsource judgment, ethics, values to AI,
    - just because a company has access to information, doesn't mean that it can use it any way it wants
    - The rise of fake data

    - AI presents a wide range of hidden dangers for companies, especially in areas such as regulatory compliance, law, privacy and ethics.
    - “Deploying AI in any highly regulated industry may create regulatory compliance problems.”
    - “If an algorithm malfunctions, or even functions properly but in the wrong context, for example, there is a risk of significant losses to a trading company or investors,”
    - Unlike a physician, who might have the value of other contextual information about a patient, or even intuition developed over years of practice, the results from AI and machine learning programs can be narrow and incomplete.
    - “We should not trust machines with decisions when the costs of error are too high,”
    - “The main issue is who will be held responsible if the machine reaches the ‘wrong’ conclusion or recommends a course of action that proves harmful,”

**Why You’re Not Getting Value from Your Data Science** [(link)](https://hbr.org/2016/12/why-youre-not-getting-value-from-your-data-science)
- the data is a mess.
- In its rawest form, even clean data is too overwhelming and complex to be understood at first glance, even by experts.
- due to the time it takes to understand, formulate, and process data for a machine learning problem, machine learning experts often instead focus on the later parts of the pipeline—trying different models
- While business experts are coming up with problems, machine learning experts cannot always keep up.
- machine learning experts often didn’t build their work around the final objective—deriving business value.
- the machine learning experts wanted to spend their time building models, not processing massive datasets or translating business problems into prediction problems
- the current technological landscape, both commercial and academic, focuses on enabling more sophisticated models
