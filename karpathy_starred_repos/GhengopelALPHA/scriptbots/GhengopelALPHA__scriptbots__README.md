This is a Windows version of Scriptbots, originally by Andrej Karpathy, continued by Julian Hershey

Project Home: https://sites.google.com/site/scriptbotsevo/home

To compile scriptbots you will need:
* CMake >= 2.8 (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
* OpenGL, GLUT (http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/)

For windows: 
Extracting the .zip file with the version number inside the download will give the executable and its parts. Tested on a 
 Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 10 machines.
If you wish to edit the source code, you will need to run CMake first on the source code. If you use VC++, there are several
 other steps you might need to take, including setting several flags and ignoring certain libraries. I can't tell what steps
 you should take because honestly, I don't know what they are (I only do this as a hobby, my skills are limited)
Once running, the program will generate two folders, "saves" and "saved agents", and a "settings.cfg" file.
