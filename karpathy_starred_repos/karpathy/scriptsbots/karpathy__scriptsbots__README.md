This is a cross platform version of ScriptBots by Andrej Karpathy.

Project Home: https://sites.google.com/site/scriptbotsevo/home

To compile scriptbots you will need:
* CMake >= 2.8 (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
* OpenGL and GLUT (http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/)
* * Linux: freeglut (http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) 

To build ScriptBots on Linux:
$ cd path/to/source
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../ # this is the equiv of ./configure
$ make

To execute ScriptBots simply type the following in the build directory:
$ ./scriptbots


For windows: 
Follow basically the same steps, but after running cmake open up the VS solution (.sln) file it generates and compile the project from VS.

See README.txt for controls and a message from Andrej
