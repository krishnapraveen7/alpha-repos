[Skyvern](https://www.skyvern.com) automates browser-based workflows using LLMs and computer vision. It provides a simple API endpoint to fully automate manual workflows on a large number of websites, replacing brittle or unreliable automation solutions. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/geico_shu_recording_cropped.gif"/>
</p>

Traditional approaches to browser automations required writing custom scripts for websites, often relying on DOM parsing and XPath-based interactions which would break whenever the website layouts changed.

Instead of only relying on code-defined XPath interactions, Skyvern relies on prompts in addition to computer vision and LLMs to the mix to parse items in the viewport in real-time, create a plan for interaction and interact with them.

This approach gives us a few advantages:

1. Skyvern can operate on websites it‚Äôs never seen before, as it‚Äôs able to map visual elements to actions necessary to complete a workflow, without any customized code
1. Skyvern is resistant to website layout changes, as there are no pre-determined XPaths or other selectors our system is looking for while trying to navigate
1. Skyvern is able to take a single workflow and apply it to a large number of websites, as it‚Äôs able to reason through the interactions necessary to complete the workflow
1. Skyvern leverages LLMs to reason through interactions to ensure we can cover complex situations. Examples include:
    1. If you wanted to get an auto insurance quote from Geico, the answer to a common question ‚ÄúWere you eligible to drive at 18?‚Äù could be inferred from the driver receiving their license at age 16
    1. If you were doing competitor analysis, it‚Äôs understanding that an Arnold Palmer 22 oz can at 7/11 is almost definitely the same product as a 23 oz can at Gopuff (even though the sizes are slightly different, which could be a rounding error!)

# How it works
Skyvern was inspired by the Task-Driven autonomous agent design popularized by [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) and [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT) -- with one major bonus: we give Skyvern the ability to interact with websites using browser automation libraries like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

<!-- TODO (suchintan): 
Expand the diagram above to go deeper into how:
1. We draw bounding boxes
2. We parse the HTML + extract the image to generate an interactable element map

# Skyvern Cloud
We offer a managed cloud version of Skyvern that allows you to run Skyvern without having to manage the infrastructure. It allows to you run multiple Skyvern instances in parallel to automate your workflows at scale. In addition, Skyvern cloud comes bundled with anti-bot detection mechanisms, proxy network, and CAPTCHA solving to allow you to complete more complicated workflows.

If you'd like to try it out, 
1. Navigate to [app.skyvern.com](https://app.skyvern.com)
2. Create an account
3. Set up your credit card information to get $5 of credits on us
4. Kick off your first task and see Skyvern in action!

Here are some tips that may help you on your adventure:
1. Skyvern is really good at carrying out one task. If you give it too many instructions to do, it has a high likelihood of getting confused along the way.
2. Being really explicit about goals is very important. For example, if you're generating an insurance quote, let it know very clearly how it can identify it's accomplished its goals. Use words like "COMPLETE" or "TERMINATE" to indicate success and failure modes, respectively.
3. If you'd like to do more advanced things such as chaining multiple instructions together, or securely logging in, please feel free to book some time with me! I'm always happy to help


# Quickstart

## Debugging Skyvern
Skyvern's visualizer allows you to debug every interaction Skyvern takes on the web.

https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern/assets/3853670/99827aaf-6818-420e-a90a-edc1593ff71e


### Tasks, Steps, and Actions
Each API request you sent to Skyvern is called a "task". Each task is made up of "steps" which are the individual actions Skyvern takes to complete the task. Each step is made up of "actions" which are the individual interactions Skyvern takes on a particular website.

Every time you call the API, you will be given a task_id you can use to find a task within the visualizer. Within each task, you'll be able to interact with each step, and see the specific actions Skyvern took to complete the task.

In the screenshot below, we're navigating to finditparts.com and searching for a truck part. You'll see each action it took listed there, alongside the reasoning behind each action.
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/skyvern_visualizer_debug_llm_response.png"/>
</p>


In addition to the actions suggested by the LLM in text form, Skyvern's visualizer also shows the state of the screen at the time of the action, with a 1:1 action to screenshot mapping. This allows you to see exactly what Skyvern saw when it made a decision, and debug any issues that may have arisen.
