# GLM-130B: An Open Bilingual Pre-Trained Model

GLM-130B is an open bilingual (English & Chinese) bidirectional dense model with 130 billion parameters, pre-trained using the algorithm of [General Language Model (GLM)](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.26). It is designed to support inference tasks with the 130B parameters on **a single A100 (40G * 8)** or **V100 (32G * 8) server**. With INT4 quantization, the  hardware requirements can further be reduced to **a single server with 4 * RTX 3090 (24G)** with **almost no performance degradation**. As of July 3rd, 2022, GLM-130B has been trained on over 400 billion text tokens (200B each for Chinese and English) and it has the following unique features:
 
- **Bilingual:** supports both English and Chinese. 
- **Performance (EN):** better than GPT-3 175B (+4.0%), OPT-175B (+5.5%), and BLOOM-176B (+13.0%) on LAMBADA and slightly better than GPT-3 175B (+0.9%) on MMLU.
- **Performance (CN):** significantly better than ERNIE TITAN 3.0 260B on 7 zero-shot CLUE datasets (+24.26%) and 5 zero-shot FewCLUE datasets (+12.75%). 
- **Fast Inference:** supports fast inference on both [SAT](https://github.com/THUDM/SwissArmyTransformer) and [FasterTransformer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer) (up to 2.5X faster) with a single A100 server.
- **Reproducibility:** all results (30+ tasks) can be easily reproduced with open-sourced code and model checkpoints.
- **Cross-Platform:** supports training and inference on NVIDIA, Hygon DCU, Ascend 910, and Sunway (Will be released soon).

This repository mainly focus on the evaluation of GLM-130B. If you find our work and our open-sourced efforts useful, ‚≠êÔ∏è to encourage our following development! :)

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

#### Hardware

| **Hardware**    | **GPU Memory** | **Quantization** | **Weight Offload** |
| --------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| 8 * A100        | 40 GB          | No               | No                 |
| 8 * V100        | 32 GB          | No               | Yes (BMInf)        |
| 8 * V100        | 32 GB          | INT8             | No                 |
| 8 * RTX 3090    | 24 GB          | INT8             | No                 |
| 4 * RTX 3090    | 24 GB          | INT4             | No                 |
| 8 * RTX 2080 Ti | 11 GB          | INT4             | No        |

It is recommended to use the an A100 (40G * 8) server, as all GLM-130B evaluation results (~30 tasks) reported can be easily reproduced with a single A100 server in about half a day. With INT8/INT4 quantization, efficient inference on **a single server with 4 * RTX 3090 (24G)** is possible, see [Quantization of GLM-130B](docs/quantization.md) for details. Combining quantization and weight offloading techniques, GLM-130B can also be inferenced on servers with even smaller GPU memory, see [Low-Resource Inference](docs/low-resource-inference.md) for details.

#### Software

The GLM-130B code is built on the top of [SAT](https://github.com/THUDM/SwissArmyTransformer). We recommend using [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to manage your environment and installing additional dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Here are the recommended environment configurations:

- Python 3.9+ / CUDA 11+ / PyTorch 1.10+ / DeepSpeed 0.6+ / Apex (**installation with CUDA and C++ extensions is required, see [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex/#linux)**)
- SwissArmyTransformer>=0.2.11 is required for quantization

#### Model weights

Download the GLM-130B‚Äôs model checkpoint from [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehr5Dh_i3TwACmFFi8QEgIVNYGmSPwV0GueIcsUev0NEfUug/viewform?usp=sf_link), make sure all 60 chunks are downloaded completely, then use the following command to merge them into a single archive file and extract it:

```bash
cat glm-130b-sat.tar.part_* > glm-130b-sat.tar
tar xvf glm-130b-sat.tar
```

Set `CHECKPOINT_PATH` in `configs/model_glm_130b.sh` to the path of the extracted folder. Since the checkpoint file is up to 260G, it is recommended to use the SSD or RAM disk to reduce the checkpoint loading time. Since the checkpoint we distribute is in 8-way tensor parallel, a conversion scripts is also provided if you need to change the tensor parallel dimension.

```bash
python tools/convert_tp.py \
    --input-folder <SRC_CKPT_PATH>  \
    --output-folder <DST_CKPT_PATH> \
    --target-tp <TARGET_TP>
```

### Left-To-Right Generation / Blank Filling

```bash
bash scripts/generate.sh --input-source interactive
```

You can also specify an input file by `--input-source input.txt`.

GLM-130B uses two different mask tokens: `[MASK]` for short blank filling and `[gMASK]` for left-to-right long text generation. When the input does not contain any MASK token, `[gMASK]` will be automatically appended to the end of the text.

<details>
<summary><b>Left-To-Right Generation Examples</b></summary>
    
#### Example 1
Input: Who is the greatest artist? The greatest artist is [gMASK]

Output: Who is the greatest artist? The greatest artist is not the one who paints the most beautiful picture, or writes the best poem, or plays the best symphony. The greatest artist is the one whose work has the greatest impact on the lives of others. The Greatest Artist is the artist who inspires us to be our best selves. The Great Artist is not the artist whose work is flawless. The great artist is not one who is perfect. The true great artist has the ability to make us feel something. The artist who makes us feel is the great artist. The art of the great artists is to make you feel something that you have never felt before. The greatness of an artist is in the ability of their work to touch the lives and hearts of others, and to make them feel something they have never experienced before. This is the true greatness of the artist. 2. The Significance of the Great Artist The significance of the greatest artist cannot be overstated. The significance and impact of the art of a great artist cannot even be measured. The impact of a single work of art can change the course of history. A single work can change a person‚Äôs life. A work of great art can make you laugh, make you cry, make your heart race, or make you think. A great work of artistic expression has the power to change the way you look at the world. The work of a truly great artist can change your life forever. 3. The Impact of the Greatest Artist The greatest artists have the ability and the power of their art to change people‚Äôs lives. They have the power and the ability, through their art, to make people feel something new. The power of the work of the truly great artists cannot be measured, but it can be felt. The greater the impact of an artists work, the greater the power it has to change lives. 4. The Influence of the Art of the Artist The art and the work created by the greatest artists has the potential to change a life. The influence of the artists work cannot be quantified, but is felt by those who experience it. The truly great work has an ability to touch people‚Äô lives in a way that no other work can.

### Evaluation

We use the YAML file to define tasks. Specifically, you can add multiple tasks or folders at a time for evaluation, and the evaluation script will automatically collect all YAML files under those folders recursively.

```
bash scripts/evaluate.sh task1.yaml task2.yaml dir1 dir2 ...
```

Download our evaluation dataset [here](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/826f0df4356f4022a264/), and set `DATA_PATH` in `scripts/evaluate.sh` to your local dataset directory. The task folder contains the YAML files for 30+ tasks we evaluated for GLM-130B. Take the [CoLA](https://nyu-mll.github.io/CoLA/) task for example, run `bash scripts/evaluate.sh tasks/bloom/glue_cola.yaml`, which outputs an accuracy of ~65% for the best prompt and ~57% for the median.

<details>
<summary>Expected Output</summary>

      Finish Previous_sentence_acceptable/mul/validation.jsonl, Accuracy = 65.197
      Finish editing/mul/validation.jsonl, Accuracy = 57.622
      Finish is_this_correct/mul/validation.jsonl, Accuracy = 65.197
Evaluation results of task glue_cola:
  Group validation Accuracy: max = 65.197, median = 57.622, average = 57.526
Finish task glue_cola in 101.2s. 
```
</details>

Multi-node evaluation can be configured by setting `HOST_FILE_PATH`(required by the [DeepSpeed lanucher](https://www.deepspeed.ai/getting-started/#resource-configuration-multi-node)) in `scripts/evaluate_multiple_node.sh`. Set `DATA_PATH` in `scripts/evaluate_multiple_node.sh` and run the following command to evaluate all the tasks in `./task` directory.

```
bash scripts/evaluate_multiple_node.sh ./tasks
```

See [Evaluate Your Own Tasks](docs/evaluate-your-own-tasks.md) for details on how to add new tasks.

### 2.5X faster Inference using FasterTransformer

By adapting the GLM-130B model to [FasterTransfomer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/FasterTransformer), a highly optimized transformer model library by NVIDIA, we can reach up to 2.5X speedup on generation, see [Inference with FasterTransformer](docs/inference-with-fastertransformer.md) for details.
