Objaverse-XL is an open dataset of over 10 million 3D objects!

With it, we train Zero123-XL, a foundation model for 3D, observing incredible 3D generalization abilities: üßµüëá

## Scale Comparison

Objaverse 1.0 was released back in December. It was a step in the right direction, but still relatively small with 800K objects.

Objaverse-XL is over an order of magnitude larger and much more diverse!

## Unlocking Generalization

Compared to the original Zero123 model, Zero123-XL improves remarkably in 0-shot generalization abilities, even being able to perform novel view synthesis on sketches, cartoons, and people!

A ton more examples in the [üìù paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05663) :)

## Image ‚Üí 3D

With the base Zero123-XL foundation model, we can perform image ‚Üí 3D using [DreamFusion](https://dreamfusion3d.github.io/), having the model guide a NeRF to generate novel views!

## Text ‚Üí 3D

Text-to-3D comes for free with text ‚Üí image models, such as with SDXL here, providing the initial image!

## Scaling Trends

Beyond that, we show strong scaling trends for both Zero123-XL and [PixelNeRF](https://alexyu.net/pixelnerf/)!
