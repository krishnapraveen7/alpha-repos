*DIG: Dive into Graphs* is a turnkey library for graph deep learning research.

:fire:**Update (2022/07): We have upgraded our DIG library based on PyG 2.0.0. We recommend installing our latest version.**

## Why DIG?

The key difference with current graph deep learning libraries, such as PyTorch Geometric (PyG) and Deep Graph Library (DGL), is that, while PyG and DGL support basic graph deep learning operations, DIG provides a unified testbed for higher-level, research-oriented graph deep learning tasks, such as graph generation, self-supervised learning, explainability, 3D graphs, and graph out-of-distribution.

If you are working or plan to work on research in graph deep learning, DIG enables you to develop your own methods within our extensible framework, and compare with current baseline methods using common datasets and evaluation metrics without extra effort.

## Overview

It includes unified implementations of **data interfaces**, **common algorithms**, and **evaluation metrics** for several advanced tasks. Our goal is to enable researchers to easily implement and benchmark algorithms. Currently, we consider the following research directions.

* **Graph Generation**: `dig.ggraph`
* **Self-supervised Learning on Graphs**: `dig.sslgraph`
* **Explainability of Graph Neural Networks**: `dig.xgraph`
* **Deep Learning on 3D Graphs**: `dig.threedgraph`
* **Graph OOD**: `dig.oodgraph`
* **Graph Augmentation**: `dig.auggraph`
* **Fair Graph Learning**: `dig.fairgraph`

## Usage

Example: a few lines of code to run [SphereNet](https://openreview.net/forum?id=givsRXsOt9r) on [QM9](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201422) to incorporate 3D information of molecules.


```python
from dig.threedgraph.dataset import QM93D
from dig.threedgraph.method import SphereNet
from dig.threedgraph.evaluation import ThreeDEvaluator
from dig.threedgraph.method import run

# Load the dataset and split
dataset = QM93D(root='dataset/')
target = 'U0'
dataset.data.y = dataset.data[target]
split_idx = dataset.get_idx_split(len(dataset.data.y), train_size=110000, valid_size=10000, seed=42)
train_dataset, valid_dataset, test_dataset = dataset[split_idx['train']], dataset[split_idx['valid']], dataset[split_idx['test']]

# Define model, loss, and evaluation
model = SphereNet(energy_and_force=False, cutoff=5.0, num_layers=4,
                  hidden_channels=128, out_channels=1, int_emb_size=64,
                  basis_emb_size_dist=8, basis_emb_size_angle=8, basis_emb_size_torsion=8, out_emb_channels=256,
                  num_spherical=3, num_radial=6, envelope_exponent=5,
                  num_before_skip=1, num_after_skip=2, num_output_layers=3)                 
loss_func = torch.nn.L1Loss()
evaluation = ThreeDEvaluator()

# Train and evaluate
run3d = run()
run3d.run(device, train_dataset, valid_dataset, test_dataset, model, loss_func, evaluation,
          epochs=20, batch_size=32, vt_batch_size=32, lr=0.0005, lr_decay_factor=0.5, lr_decay_step_size=15)

```
