## Examples

Example workflows and images can be found in the [Examples Section](examples) folder. 

- **[Example_agents.json](examples/Example_agents.json)** - shows you how to create conversible agents, with various examples of how they could be setup.
- **[Example_groq_search.json](examples/Example_groq_search.json)** - shows you how to search with a Groq LLM model, featuring Tavily Research node.
- **[Example_SERP_search.json](examples/Example_SERP_search.json)** - shows you how to search with Scale SERP, and also demonstrates how to use different models with same setup. 
- **[Example_search_to_json.json](examples/Example_search_to_json.json)** - shows you how to take search results, and convert them to JSON output which could be fed to another system for use. 

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues due to package conflicts, ensure your virtual environment is configured correctly.

## Acquiring Models

You can install and use any GGUF files loaded into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/models/llm` folder.

Here is probably the world's largest repository of those:
