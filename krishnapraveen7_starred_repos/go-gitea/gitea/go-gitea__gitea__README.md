## Purpose

The goal of this project is to make the easiest, fastest, and most
painless way of setting up a self-hosted Git service.

As Gitea is written in Go, it works across **all** the platforms and
architectures that are supported by Go, including Linux, macOS, and
Windows on x86, amd64, ARM and PowerPC architectures.
This project has been
[forked](https://blog.gitea.com/welcome-to-gitea/) from
[Gogs](https://gogs.io) since November of 2016, but a lot has changed.

For online demonstrations, you can visit [demo.gitea.com](https://demo.gitea.com).

For accessing free Gitea service (with a limited number of repositories), you can visit [gitea.com](https://gitea.com/user/login).

To quickly deploy your own dedicated Gitea instance on Gitea Cloud, you can start a free trial at [cloud.gitea.com](https://cloud.gitea.com).

## Building

From the root of the source tree, run:

    TAGS="bindata" make build

or if SQLite support is required:

    TAGS="bindata sqlite sqlite_unlock_notify" make build

The `build` target is split into two sub-targets:

- `make backend` which requires [Go Stable](https://go.dev/dl/), the required version is defined in [go.mod](/go.mod).
- `make frontend` which requires [Node.js LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or greater.

Internet connectivity is required to download the go and npm modules. When building from the official source tarballs which include pre-built frontend files, the `frontend` target will not be triggered, making it possible to build without Node.js.

## Using

    ./gitea web

> [!NOTE]
> If you're interested in using our APIs, we have experimental support with [documentation](https://docs.gitea.com/api).

## Contributing

Expected workflow is: Fork -> Patch -> Push -> Pull Request

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. **YOU MUST READ THE [CONTRIBUTORS GUIDE](CONTRIBUTING.md) BEFORE STARTING TO WORK ON A PULL REQUEST.**
> 2. If you have found a vulnerability in the project, please write privately to **security@gitea.io**. Thanks!

## Translating

Translations are done through Crowdin. If you want to translate to a new language ask one of the managers in the Crowdin project to add a new language there.

You can also just create an issue for adding a language or ask on discord on the #translation channel. If you need context or find some translation issues, you can leave a comment on the string or ask on Discord. For general translation questions there is a section in the docs. Currently a bit empty but we hope to fill it as questions pop up.
