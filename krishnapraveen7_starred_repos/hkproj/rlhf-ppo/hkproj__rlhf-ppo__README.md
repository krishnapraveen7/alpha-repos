# Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
Notes and commented code for RLHF (PPO)

The code has been commented by using the trl library from Hugging Face with version 0.7.10: https://github.com/huggingface/trl/

You will find the original code of the `ppo_trainer.py` file and also the commented code. You can use any diff tool to check my comments.
