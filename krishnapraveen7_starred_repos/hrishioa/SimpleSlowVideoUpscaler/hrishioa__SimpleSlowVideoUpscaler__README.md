I was super impressed with the output from [tile upscaler](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gokaygokay/Tile-Upscaler), and the outputs were stable enough to use for video. If you take time tuning the settings, you can get a pretty good output - except that the model (or the LoRA) wants to give everyone eye makeup.

**This is just meant to be a simple script so I could run some videos through. Not for production usage!**

I haven't been able to fully get it working on M1 Macs (with the ANE). Any help appreciated!

# Installation

First install cuda for your python if not already present:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.py
```

Install ffmpeg - [get it here for Windows](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html), or for POSIX:

```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

Run the upscaler!

```bash
python upscaler.py
```

# Usage

![CleanShot 2024-07-14 at 11 47 30@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0cb7b76-eba3-4535-99fb-c0a6a130fcd6)

You can abort processing at any time. Max frames to process, and skipping frames is super helpful if you just want to check the output. The defaults are sensible ones I found work in general. Play with the resolution - some videos work better at higher res (even though they themselves are lower res) and sometimes otherwise!
