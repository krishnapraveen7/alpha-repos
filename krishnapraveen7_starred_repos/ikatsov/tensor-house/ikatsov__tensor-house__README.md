## What is TensorHouse? 
TensorHouse is a collection of reference Jupyter notebooks and demo AI/ML applications for enterprise use cases: marketing, pricing, supply chain, smart manufacturing, and more. The goal of the project is to provide a toolkit for rapid readiness assessment, exploratory data analysis, and prototyping of various modeling approaches for typical enterprise AI/ML/data science projects.

TensorHouse provides the following resources:
* A well-documented repository of reference notebooks and demo applications (prototypes).
* Readiness assessment and requirement gathering questionnaires for typical enterprise AI/ML projects.
* Datasets, data generators, and simulators for rapid prototyping and model evaluation.

TensorHouse focuses mainly on industry-proven solutions that leverage deep learning, reinforcement learning, and casual inference methods and models. Most of these solutions were originally developed either by industry practitioners or by academic researchers who worked in collaboration with leading companies in technology, retail, manufacturing, and other sectors.

## How Does TensorHouse Help?
TensorHouse helps to accelerate the following steps of the solution development:
1. Faster evaluate readiness for specific use cases from the data, integration, and process perspectives using questionnaires and casual inference templates. 
2. Choose candidate methods and models for solving your use cases, evaluate and tailor them using simulators and sample datasets. 
3. Evaluate candidate methods and models on your data, build prototypes, and present preliminary results to stakeholders. 

## What Libs Does TensorHouse Use?
All prototypes and template are implemented in Python using a limited set of standard libraries: 
* Deep learning: mostly `TensorFlow`, some prototypes use `PyTorch`
* Reinforcement learning: `RLlib`
* Causal inference: `DoWhy`, `EconML`
* Probabilistic programming / Bayesian inference: `PyMC`
* Generative AI: `LangChain`
* Traditional ML: `statsmodels`, `scikit-learn`, `LightGBM`
* Basic libs: `NumPy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
