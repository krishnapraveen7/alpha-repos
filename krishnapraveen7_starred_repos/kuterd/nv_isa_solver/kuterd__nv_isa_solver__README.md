# Nvidia Instruction Set Specification Generator
This is a project for automatically generating instruction set specifications for NVIDIA GPUs by fuzzing the nvdisasm program included in Cuda

Human readable ISA Spec for SM90a (Hopper) is [here](https://kuterdinel.com/nv_isa/).
Human readable ISA Spec for SM89 (RTX4090) is [here](https://kuterdinel.com/nv_isa_sm89/).
