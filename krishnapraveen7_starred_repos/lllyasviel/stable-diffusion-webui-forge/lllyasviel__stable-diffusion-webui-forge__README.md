# Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge

Stable Diffusion WebUI Forge is a platform on top of [Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) (based on [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/)) to make development easier, optimize resource management, speed up inference, and study experimental features.

The name "Forge" is inspired from "Minecraft Forge". This project is aimed at becoming SD WebUI's Forge.

Forge is currently based on SD-WebUI 1.10.1 at [this commit](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/commit/82a973c04367123ae98bd9abdf80d9eda9b910e2).

# Installing Forge

If you are proficient in Git and you want to install Forge as another branch of SD-WebUI, please see [here](https://github.com/continue-revolution/sd-webui-animatediff/blob/forge/master/docs/how-to-use.md#you-have-a1111-and-you-know-git). In this way, you can reuse all SD checkpoints and all extensions you installed previously in your OG SD-WebUI, but you should know what you are doing.

If you know what you are doing, you can install Forge using same method as SD-WebUI. (Install Git, Python, Git Clone the forge repo `https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge.git` and then run webui-user.bat).

**Or you can just use this one-click installation package (with git and python included).**

[>>> Click Here to Download One-Click Package <<<](https://github.com/lllyasviel/stable-diffusion-webui-forge/releases/download/latest/webui_forge_cu121_torch21.7z)

After you download, you uncompress, use `update.bat` to update, and use `run.bat` to run.

Note that running `update.bat` is important, otherwise you may be using a previous version with potential bugs unfixed.

Feel free to open issue if anything is broken and I will take a look every several days. If I do not update this "Forge Status" then it means I cannot reproduce any problem. In that case, fresh re-install should help most.
