## Sample Code

Samples that show how to use microsoft-bonsai-api and connect with the Bonsai platform.

### Python

[cartpole](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Python/samples/cartpole) - Classic CartPole simulator in Python. Balancing an inverted pendulum on a moving cart.

[gym-highway](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Python/samples/gym-highway) - Make decisions to speed up, slow down, change lanes, etc with a multi-lane highway. This sample uses arrays in Inkling for states and demonstrates usage of using an element of the array in the reward.

[house-energy](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Python/samples/house-energy) - Control the temperature inside of a house according to the desired set temperatures just like a thermostat.

[microgrid](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Python/samples/microgrid) - Control a local energy grid to meet the load by charging or discharging the battery, importing or exporting energy from the traditional grid, and consuming generated PV power.

[plastic-extrusion](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Python/samples/plastic-extrusion) - Control a plastic extruder to optimize production of PVC rods with a specified length and tolerance.

[quanser-qube](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Python/samples/quanser-qube) - Simulation of the real hardware, academic learning tool: Quanser Qube. Swing Up and Balancing an inverted pendulum with a rotary base.

[simple-adder](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Python/samples/simple-adder) - A minimal working example of a Python simulator that can be connected to Bonsai and used to train a brain. You can think of it as Project Bonsai's "Hello World".

### C#

[cartpole](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/CSharp/samples/Microsoft.Bonsai.Api.Samples.Cartpole) - Classic CartPole simulator in C#. Balancing an inverted pendulum on a moving cart.

### Java

[cartpole](https://github.com/microsoft/cartpole-java) - Classic CartPole simulator in Java. Balancing an inverted pendulum on a moving cart.

### Typescript

[adder](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-bonsai-api/tree/main/Typescript/samples/adder) - Simple simulator that adds numbers and computes a reward based on the result.

## Other Bonsai repositories

[bonsai-common](https://github.com/microsoft/bonsai-common) - A Python framework for interfacing with the bonsai platform.

[bonsai-sim-connector-template](https://github.com/microsoft/bonsai-sim-connector-template) - A template for creating Bonsai Connectors. It can serve as a starting point for making a simulation platform work with Bonsai.

[moabsim-py](https://github.com/microsoft/moabsim-py) - Simulator for balancing a ball on a plate, based on hardware. Tutorial 2 is meant for deployment. Additional Inkling samples can be found in `/Machine-Teaching-Examples`.

## Simulator Integration Checklist & Best Practices
- [ ] Make sure workspace is registered & correct.
- [ ] **Error handling**: Any cloud service can have transient errors and our SDK have Retry policy in place, but not all errors can be retried, so a good error handling logic will make your sim sessions more robust. Please check cartpole sim sample, for the hints.
- [ ] Make sure there is a Re-Register (Re create sim session), in the error handling logic, when you are unregistering or deleting sim. To make sure, sim will keep running.
- [ ] **Enable verbose SDK logging**: If you are hitting issues. Enable logging in BonsaiClientConfig. And set the right LogLevel to get more information.
- [ ] For hosted sim, You can also enable Sim logging for Episodes, iterations and system log, using our CLI commands ([1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bonsai/cli/brain/version/start-training), [2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bonsai/cli/brain/version/start-logging)) for start-training and start-logging. These logs will go to Log Analytics workspace.
