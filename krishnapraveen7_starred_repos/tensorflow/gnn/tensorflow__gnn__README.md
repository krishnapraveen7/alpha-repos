# TensorFlow GNN

## Summary

TensorFlow GNN is a library to build
[Graph Neural Networks](tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/intro.md) on the TensorFlow platform.
It provides...

  * a [`tfgnn.GraphTensor`](tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/graph_tensor.md) type to represent
    graphs with a [heterogeneous schema](tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/schema.md), that is,
    multiple types of nodes and edges;
  * tools for [data preparation](tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/data_prep.md),
    notably a [graph sampler](tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/beam_sampler.md)
    to convert a huge database into a stream of reasonably-sized subgraphs for
    training and inference;
  * a collection of [ready-to-use models](tensorflow_gnn/models/README.md)
    and Keras layers to do your own [GNN modeling](tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/gnn_modeling.md);
  * a high-level API for training [orchestration](tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/runner.md).

This library is an OSS port of a Google-internal library used in a broad variety
of contexts, on homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, and in conjunction with
other scalable graph mining tools.

For background, please see our
[blog post](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2024/02/graph-neural-networks-in-tensorflow.html)
and the [TF-GNN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03522) (full citation below).

## Quickstart

Google Colab lets you run TF-GNN demos from your browser, no installation
required:

  * [Molecular Graph
    Classification](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/gnn/blob/master/examples/notebooks/intro_mutag_example.ipynb)
     with the MUTAG dataset.
  * [Solving OGBN-MAG
    end-to-end](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/gnn/blob/master/examples/notebooks/ogbn_mag_e2e.ipynb)
    trains a model on heterogeneous sampled subgraphs from the popular
    [OGBN-MAG](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-mag) benchmark.
  * [Learning shortest paths with
    GraphNetworks](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/gnn/blob/master/examples/notebooks/graph_network_shortest_path.ipynb)
    demonstrates an advanced Encoder/Process/Decoder architecture for predicting
    the edges of a shortest path.

[Documentation overview](tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/overview.md)
page, which also links to the
[API docs](tensorflow_gnn/docs/api_docs/README.md).

## Installation Instructions

The latest stable release of TensorFlow GNN is available from

```
pip install tensorflow-gnn
```

For installation from source, see our [Developer
Guide](tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/developer.md).

Key platform requirements:

  * TensorFlow 2.12 or higher, and any GPU drivers it needs
    [[instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)].
  * Keras v2, as traditionally included with TensorFlow 2.x.
    TF-GNN does not work with the new multi-backend Keras v3.<br/>
    **Users of TF2.16+ must also `pip install tf-keras` and set
    TF_USE_LEGACY_KERAS=1**,
    see our [Keras version](tensorflow_gnn/docs/guide/keras_version.md) guide for details.
  * Apache Beam for distributed graph sampling.

TF-GNN is developed and tested on Linux. Running on other platforms supported
by TensorFlow may be possible.
