## Intro

The goal of this project is to create a **set of standard AI functions / tools** which are **optimized for both normal TS-usage as well as LLM-based apps** and that work with all of the major AI SDKs (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Vercel AI SDK, OpenAI SDK, etc).

For example, stdlib clients like `WeatherClient` can be used as normal TS classes:

```ts
import { WeatherClient } from '@agentic/stdlib'

const weather = new WeatherClient() // (requires `WEATHER_API_KEY` env var)

const result = await weather.getCurrentWeather({
  q: 'San Francisco'
})
console.log(result)
```

Or you can use these clients as **LLM-based tools** where the LLM decides when and how to invoke the underlying functions for you.

This works across all of the major AI SDKs via adaptors. Here's an example using [Vercel's AI SDK](https://github.com/vercel/ai):

```ts
// sdk-specific imports
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'
import { generateText } from 'ai'
import { createAISDKTools } from '@agentic/stdlib/ai-sdk'

// sdk-agnostic imports
import { WeatherClient } from '@agentic/stdlib'

const weather = new WeatherClient()

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
  // this is the key line which uses the `@agentic/stdlib/ai-sdk` adaptor
  tools: createAISDKTools(weather),
  toolChoice: 'required',
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?'
})

console.log(result.toolResults[0])
```

You can use our standard library of thoroughly tested AI functions with your favorite AI SDK – without having to write any glue code!

Here's a slightly more complex example which uses multiple clients and selects a subset of their functions using the `AIFunctionSet.pick` method:

```ts
// sdk-specific imports
import { ChatModel, createAIRunner } from '@dexaai/dexter'
import { createDexterFunctions } from '@agentic/stdlib/dexter'

// sdk-agnostic imports
import { PerigonClient, SerperClient } from '@agentic/stdlib'

async function main() {
  // Perigon is a news API and Serper is a Google search API
  const perigon = new PerigonClient()
  const serper = new SerperClient()

  const runner = createAIRunner({
    chatModel: new ChatModel({
      params: { model: 'gpt-4o', temperature: 0 }
    }),
    functions: createDexterFunctions(
      perigon.functions.pick('search_news_stories'),
      serper
    ),
    systemMessage: `You are a helpful assistant. Be as concise as possible.`
  })

  const result = await runner(
    'Summarize the latest news stories about the upcoming US election.'
  )
  console.log(result)
}
```

Here we've exposed 2 functions to the LLM, `search_news_stories` (which comes from the `PerigonClient.searchStories` method) and `serper_google_search` (which implicitly comes from the `SerperClient.search` method).

All of the SDK adaptors like `createDexterFunctions` accept very flexible in what they accept. `AIFunctionLike` objects include:

- `AIFunctionSet` - Sets of AI functions (like `perigon.functions.pick('search_news_stories')` or `perigon.functions` or `serper.functions`)
- `AIFunctionsProvider` - Client classes which expose an `AIFunctionSet` via the `.functions` property (like `perigon` or `serper`)
- `AIFunction` - Individual functions (like `perigon.functions.get('search_news_stories')` or `serper.functions.get('serper_google_search')` or AI functions created directly via the `createAIFunction` utility function)

You can pass as many of these `AIFunctionLike` objects as you'd like and you can manipulate them as `AIFunctionSet` sets via `.pick`, `.omit`, `.get`, `.map`, etc.

## Install

```sh
npm install @agentic/stdlib
```

This package is [ESM only](https://gist.github.com/sindresorhus/a39789f98801d908bbc7ff3ecc99d99c) and requires `Node.js >= 18` or an equivalent environment (bun, deno, CF workers, etc).

> [!NOTE]
> All heavy third-party imports are isolated as _optional peer dependencies_ to keep the main `@agentic/stdlib` package as lightweight as possible.

Depending on the AI SDK and tool you want to use, you'll also need to install the required peer dependencies.

Note that many of these clients expose multiple AI functions.

## Compound Tools

- `SearchAndCrawl`

## AI SDKs

- OpenAI SDK
  - no need for an adaptor; use `AIFunctionSet.specs` or `AIFunctionSet.toolSpecs`
- Vercel AI SDK
  - `import { createAISDKTools } from '@agentic/stdlib/ai-sdk'`
- LangChain
  - `import { createLangChainTools } from '@agentic/stdlib/langchain'`
- LlamaIndex
  - `import { createLlamaIndexTools } from '@agentic/stdlib/llamaindex'`
- Firebase Genkit
  - `import { createGenkitTools } from '@agentic/stdlib/genkit'`
- Dexa Dexter
  - `import { createDexterFunctions } from '@agentic/stdlib/dexter'`

See the [examples](./examples) directory for examples of how to use each of these adaptors.

## Client Goals

- clients should be as minimal as possible
- clients should use `ky` and `zod` where possible
- clients should have a strongly-typed TS DX
- clients should expose select methods via the `@aiFunction(...)` decorator
  - `inputSchema` zod schemas should be as minimal as possible with descriptions prompt engineered specifically for use with LLMs
- clients and AIFunctions should be composable via `AIFunctionSet`
- clients should work with all major TS AI SDKs
  - SDK adaptors should be as lightweight as possible and be optional peer dependencies of `@agentic/stdlib`
