## Benchmarks

| Model | VQAv2 | GQA | TextVQA | TallyQA (simple) | TallyQA (full) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| moondream1 | 74.7 | 57.9 | 35.6 | - | - |
| **moondream2** (latest) | 79.4 | 63.1 | 57.2 | 82.1 | 76.6 |

## Examples

| Image | Example |
| --- | --- |
| ![](assets/demo-1.jpg) | **What is the girl doing?**<br>The girl is sitting at a table and eating a large hamburger.<br><br>**What color is the girl's hair?**<br>The girl's hair is white. |
| ![](assets/demo-2.jpg) | **What is this?**<br>This is a computer server rack, which is a device used to store and manage multiple computer servers. The rack is filled with various computer servers, each with their own dedicated space and power supply. The servers are connected to the rack via multiple cables, indicating that they are part of a larger system. The rack is placed on a carpeted floor, and there is a couch nearby, suggesting that the setup is in a living or entertainment area.<br><br>**What is behind the stand?**<br>Behind the stand, there is a brick wall. |

## Usage

**Using transformers** (recommended)

```bash
pip install transformers einops
```

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
from PIL import Image

model_id = "vikhyatk/moondream2"
revision = "2024-05-20"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id, trust_remote_code=True, revision=revision
)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id, revision=revision)

image = Image.open('<IMAGE_PATH>')
enc_image = model.encode_image(image)
print(model.answer_question(enc_image, "Describe this image.", tokenizer))
```

The model is updated regularly, so we recommend pinning the model version to a
specific release as shown above.

To enable Flash Attention on the text model, pass in `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"`
when instantiating the model.

```python
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id, trust_remote_code=True, revision=revision,
    torch_dtype=torch.float16, attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"
).to("cuda")
```

Batch inference is also supported.

```python
answers = moondream.batch_answer(
    images=[Image.open('<IMAGE_PATH_1>'), Image.open('<IMAGE_PATH_2>')],
    prompts=["Describe this image.", "Are there people in this image?"],
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)
```

**Using this repository**

Clone this repository and install dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`sample.py` provides a CLI interface for running the model. When the `--prompt` argument is not provided, the script will allow you to ask questions interactively.

```bash
python sample.py --image [IMAGE_PATH] --prompt [PROMPT]
```

Use `gradio_demo.py` script to start a Gradio interface for the model.

```bash
python gradio_demo.py
```

`webcam_gradio_demo.py` provides a Gradio interface for the model that uses your webcam as input and performs inference in real-time.

```bash
python webcam_gradio_demo.py
```

**Limitations**

* The model may generate inaccurate statements, and struggle to understand intricate or nuanced instructions.
* The model may not be free from societal biases. Users should be aware of this and exercise caution and critical thinking when using the model.
* The model may generate offensive, inappropriate, or hurtful content if it is prompted to do so.
