## Getting Started

To get started, first clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/whoiskatrin/chart-gpt.git
cd chart-gpt
```

Then duplicate the `.env.example` template with `cp .env.example .env` and add your PaLM API key:

```
BARD_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Then install the dependencies and start the development server:

```
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```

This will start the development server at http://localhost:3000.

To use the full functionality of the credit system as well, you'll need to setup Supabase, Stripe, and NextAuth with Google â€” and their respective environment variables found in the `.env.example` file.
